This dataset contains seven interconnected tables which create a complete information system which supports analysis and decision-making for order shipment and warehouse logistics and transportation management. OrderList as the main dataset holds information on over 9,000 customer orders that include shipment origin ports and carrier details with product and plant identifiers and established service levels and weights. Shipping rate structure data stored in the FreightRates table serves customers alongside PlantPorts which defines allowed shipping routes between plants and ports. The ProductsPerPlant dataset helps analysts analyze warehouse-product matching potential for fulfillment purposes. Operational limits in the model exist through WhCustomers and WhCosts because they specify warehouse storage prices and daily shipment capabilities. VmiCustomers retains the unique restrictions between particular warehouses and their specific clientele. The dataset includes a mix of moderate to high volume tables each containing between 14 and over 9,000 rows with column maximums of 14. The dataset primarily delivers operational and configuration-based time coverage rather than historical time-series data. The main PII candidate fields are customer identifiers located among the data.
