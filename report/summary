The FreightFlow Optimizer project is a comprehensive case study focused on optimizing shipping logistics and supply chain routes using Google Cloud Platform tools like BigQuery, Dataflow, and Looker Studio. It analyzes a single dayâ€™s operations across seven interconnected datasets to minimize freight and warehousing costs while satisfying operational constraints. Key insights include the dominance of PLANT03 and PORT04 in order volume and weight, the cost-efficiency of AIR shipping for bulk transport, and the identification of top-tier customers driving repeat business. The project culminates in interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision-making and operational improvements.
